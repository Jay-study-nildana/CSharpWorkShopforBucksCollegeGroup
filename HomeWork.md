# HomeWork

homework is listed here.

Note: Reference projects are available in the folder, PracticeCode.

# Day 5 

Build the class as per the algorithm discussed in the C Sharp Project, StudentDeveloper

putting the algorithm here also.

```
    //20 hours per week
    //25 weeks to become a beginner developer.
    //number of weeks already completed is 0
    //remaining weeks = 25 - 0 = 25 weeks
    //ultimately, batman will become a developer in 25 weeks.

    //10 hours per week
    //50 weeks to become a beginner developer
    //10 weeks are already completed
    //remaining weeks = 50 - 10 = 40 weeks.
    //eventually, catwoman will be a developer in 40 weeks.
```

# Day 4

1. Create a project that will
    1. A simple class
    1. class should have at least 5 properties
    1. then, use this class to create at least 3 objects in Program.cs
    1. build an output with the values stored in these 3 objects
    1. Bonus : see if you can build a function/behavior that will take care of the output from within the class itself. 

# Day 3 

1. Create a project that will
    1. a simple calculator
    1. one single function that takes two parameters
    1. then, that single function should in turn call four separate functions
    1. each of these functions are about : addition, subtraction, division and multiplication
    1. Then, show the result inside the first, single function
    1. Bonus : check for 'divide by zero' in the division function using if else

# Day 2

1. Create a project that has the following things
    1. A simple function
    1. that takes in 4 integer parameters/arguments/variables
    1. adds all these parameters using the addition operator
    1. returns the result
    1. call this function, and collect the result
    1. build a string output with all 4 integer parameters and the result
    1. display the output using console writeline

# Day 1 

1. Create a project that has the following things
    1. At least 2 string variables
    1. At least 2 integer variables
    1. At least 2 double/decimal variables
    1. Build a string that combines at least 2 strings
    1. Show all these variables in a output.
